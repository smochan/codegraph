> Language-agnostic code graph builder, analyzer, PR risk reviewer, and MCP server for Claude Code.

`codegraph` parses your repository with tree-sitter, stores a queryable graph of files / classes /
functions / imports / calls / inheritance / tests in a single SQLite file, and exposes it through a
polished CLI, a web dashboard, and a 10-tool MCP server — so you and your AI assistant always have
an accurate, lightweight map of your codebase, no daemon required.

<!-- Screenshots will be added once the dashboard is recorded. -->

## Quickstart

```bash
pip install codegraph-py           # install from PyPI (not yet published — see Install below)
codegraph init                     # interactive setup (languages, ignore globs, MCP config)
codegraph build                    # parse repo → SQLite graph
codegraph analyze                  # dead code · cycles · hotspots · untested · metrics
codegraph serve                    # open web dashboard at http://localhost:8000
codegraph review                   # graph-diff PR review with risk score
```

## Features

1. **Multi-language graph** — Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript today; pluggable tree-sitter
   extractors make adding any language a one-file change.
2. **Rich analysis** — dead code, import cycles, call hotspots, untested functions, blast-radius
   queries, and aggregate metrics — all in one command.
3. **PR review** — graph diff against a saved baseline, risk scoring, YAML rule packs, output in
   Markdown / JSON / SARIF, and an optional pre-push git hook.
4. **Web dashboard** — HLD navigator, animated focus graph, collapsible sidebar, light/dark themes;
   served locally with a single `codegraph serve`.
5. **MCP server** — 10 curated tools (`find_symbol`, `callers`, `callees`, `blast_radius`,
   `subgraph`, `dead_code`, `cycles`, `untested`, `hotspots`, `metrics`) for Claude Code or any
   MCP client.
6. **Single SQLite store** — no daemon, no database server, no network required. The entire graph
   lives in `.codegraph/graph.db`.
7. **Standalone CLI** — works fully offline, MIT licensed, zero telemetry.

## Install

```bash
pip install codegraph-py
```

> **Note:** `codegraph-py` is the PyPI distribution name. The CLI command is `codegraph`.
> The package is not yet published to PyPI — to try it today, install from source:
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/smochan/codegraph.git
> cd codegraph
> pip install -e .
> ```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `codegraph init` | Interactive setup: detect languages, configure ignore globs, optionally register MCP. |
| `codegraph build` | Walk the repo, parse with tree-sitter, write / update `graph.db`. |
| `codegraph analyze` | Run all analysis passes and print a report (Markdown or JSON). |
| `codegraph query callers <sym>` | Reverse-BFS: who calls a symbol? |
| `codegraph query subgraph <sym>` | Induced subgraph around a symbol. |
| `codegraph query deadcode` | List unreferenced functions/classes. |
| `codegraph query untested` | List functions with no incoming calls from a test module. |
| `codegraph query cycles` | Show import/call strongly-connected components. |
| `codegraph viz` | Render the graph as Mermaid, interactive HTML (pyvis), or SVG (graphviz). |
| `codegraph explore` | Interactive subgraph explorer (terminal UI). |
| `codegraph serve` | Launch the web dashboard (default port 8000). |
| `codegraph review` | Graph-diff current branch vs baseline; output risk report. |
| `codegraph baseline save` | Snapshot the current graph as a named baseline. |
| `codegraph baseline status` | Compare current graph to the saved baseline. |
| `codegraph baseline push` | Push baseline to remote store (S3 optional). |
| `codegraph hook install` | Install a pre-push git hook that runs `codegraph review`. |
| `codegraph hook uninstall` | Remove the pre-push git hook. |
| `codegraph mcp serve` | Start the MCP server (stdio transport) for Claude Code. |

## Use with Claude Code

Add to `~/.claude.json` (or register with `claude mcp add`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "codegraph": {
      "command": "codegraph",
      "args": ["mcp", "serve", "--db", ".codegraph/graph.db"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then, inside a Claude Code conversation, you can ask:

> *"Which functions have the highest blast radius in the auth module?"*
> *"Show me everything that calls `UserService.login`."*
> *"Are there any import cycles in this PR?"*

## Development

New to the repo? Read [`docs/GETTING_STARTED.md`](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md)
for the full walkthrough.

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"

ruff check .                        # lint
mypy --strict codegraph             # type-check
pytest -q                           # tests (~130 passing)
```
